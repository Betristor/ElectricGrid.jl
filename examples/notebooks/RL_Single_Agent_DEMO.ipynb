    "## Define featurize function\n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards the `featurize()` function, which gives the user the opportunity to modify a state before it gets passed to the agent, is defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes three arguments:\n",
    "- `state` contains all the state values that correspond to the source controlled by agent with key `name`\n",
    "- `env` references the environment\n",
    "- `name` contains the key of the agent\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, the signal generated by the `reference` function is added to the state provided to the agent `my_ddpg`. This will help the agent to learn because later we will define a reward that has maximum value if the measured current fits the reference value.\n",
    "The reference value has to be normalized in an appropirate way that it fits to the range of the normalized states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally more signals could be added here to enhance the learning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated before, `state` already contains all state values of the source the agent with key `name` should control.\n",
    "However, the environment maintains a lot more states than that. Through `featurize` we could expose them to the agent but we refrain from that here since we want to simulate a scenario where the source the agent controls is far away (e.g. 1km) from the load its supplying. \n",
    "In cases like this it's common that the agent has no knowlegde about states of the load since no communication and measurements exchange between source and load is assumed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In onther examples the electrical power grid consits of multiple sources and loads. The other sources are controlled by other agents or classic controllers. In that case, typically every controller / agent has knowlegde of the states of the source it controls but not about the states another agent/controller controls.\n",
    "Handing the corresponding source-depending states to the correct controllers/agents is handeled internally based on the `keys` (above: `my_ddpg`- for more information see `MultiController` and `inner_featurize` of the `env`.)"

    "Since the states are normalized by the limits the electrical components can handle, a value greater than `1` means that the state limit is exceeded typically leading to a system crash.\n",
