    "## Define featurize function\n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards the `featurize()` function, which gives the user the opportunity to modify a state before it gets passed to the agent, is defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes three arguments:\n",
    "- `state` contains all the state values that correspond to the source controlled by agent with key `name`\n",
    "- `env` references the environment\n",
    "- `name` contains the key of the agent\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the signal generated by the `reference` function is added to the state for the agent `my_ddpg`. This will help the agent to learn because later we will define a reward that has maximum value if the measured current fits the reference value.\n",
    "The reference value has to be normalized in an appropirate way that it fits to the range of the normalized states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally more signals could be added here to enhance the learning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated before, `state` already contains all state values of the source the agent with key `name` should control.\n",
    "However, the environment maintains a lot more states than that. Through `featurize` we could expose them to the agent but we refrain from that here since we want to simulate a scenario where the source the agent controls is far away (e.g. 1km) from the load its supplying. \n",
    "In cases like this it's common that the agent has no knowlegde about states of the load since no communication and measurements exchange between source and load is assumed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In onther examples the electrical power grid consits of multiple sources and loads. The other sources are controlled by other agents or classic controllers. In that case, typically every controller / agent has knowlegde of the states of the source it controls but not about the states another agent/controller controls.\n",

    "Before defining the environment, the `reward()` function has to be defined. It provides a feedback to the agent on how good the chosen action was.\n",
    "First, the state to be controlled is taken from the current environment state values.\n",
    "Since the states are normalized by the limits the electrical components can handle, a value greater than `1` means that the state limit is exceeded typically leading to a system crash.\n",

    "\n",

    "If these values are the same, meaning the agent perfectly fullfills the control task, a reward of `r = 1` is returned to the agent. ( -> r $\\in$ [-1, 1]).\n",
    "If the measured value differs from the reference, the error - based on the root-mean square error (RMSE) in this example - is substracted from the maximal reward: `r = 1 - RMSE`:\n",
    "\n",
    "$r = 1 - \\sqrt{\\frac{|i_\\mathrm{L,ref} - i_\\mathrm{L1}|}{2}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep the reward in the wanted range, the current difference is devided by 2. (E.g., in worst case, if a reference value equal to the corresponding current limit is chosen $i_\\mathrm{L,ref} = i_\\mathrm{lim}$ and the measured current is the negative current limit $i_\\mathrm{L1} = -i_\\mathrm{lim}$ more then 1 would be substracted without this normaization)."
